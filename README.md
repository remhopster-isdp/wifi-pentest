# wifi-pentest 
To perform a wifi pentest with a wifi USB adapter (see # Capable Wifi USB adapters) on a laptop with Linux / Windows there are some steps to be taken to be able 
to monitor and scan targets.

The tools to scan and monitor necessary:
**airmon-ng** and **airodump-ng** 
To use these tools we need to install the total aircrack-ng suite (see https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=getting_started)

To be able to perform a wifi pentest it is necessary to put the wifi USB adaptor in monitor mode before running airodump-ng (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng).
After the card is in monitor mode (this can be checked with iwconfig) we can run airodump-ng to capture packages (https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng) and 
to specify one specific target to scan an capture packages. The end-goal is to capture the handshake and crack the wifi password (see: Next release).

There are a lot of tutorials online. So for the processes of performing a wifi pentest please look at https://www.aircrack-ng.org and other sources.

# Scripts
The scripts automate the total process by enabling the monitor mode, start 2 separate terminals with airodump-ng.
Airodump-ng will have two terminals (automatically started):
One terminal for all networks which are found and one to specify the SSID to target.
To select the target (scope of the wifi pentest), copy or write down the information of the first terminal and answer the questions.

# Installation
Create a folder "wifi" and copy the code in this folder.

# Run
Chmod +x wifi.sh and you are able to run the script.
NOTE: It is better to run: chmod +x on the scan.sh due to an issue we will fix in the next release.
The message you will see in the second terminal will be:
chmod: changing permissions of './scan.sh': Operation not permitted

# Issue
chmod: changing permissions of './scan.sh': Operation not permitted
Will be fixed in the new Release.

# Capture and store 
In the second terminal you need to fill out the Interface-name, BSSID to scan, Channel and give a location to store the output files.
The easiest way is just give a name like: capture1 and remove these files when you start a new wifi pentest for a customer (see # Legal).

# IMPORTANT
When the wifi pentest is done and all terminals are killed.
Set the wifi UBS adapter back in managed mode!

**Command:**
sudo airmon-ng stop INTERFACENAME (name would be likelly wlan0mon).

# Next Release
- When the target is specified and the scans are running. The next phase will be to try to crack the password.
We need tools like:
aireplay-ng and aircrack-ng 
Next release we will integrate these. 

# Future project
Creating a GUI. Of course there are all great tools out there, like the Wifi Pineapple with the webinterface from HAK5. 


# Legal notice
The scripts are build for educational purposes and used with common sense. They are free to adjust.
_Hacking is illegal and without permission of the target you cannot perform a wifi pentest._
